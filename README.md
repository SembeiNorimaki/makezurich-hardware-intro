It can detect gestures, proximity, light color and light intensity.

### Measuring orientation in space of the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a 9-axis inertial measuring unit (IMU), the [LSM9DS1](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm9ds1.pdf).

This IMU includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer, all im 3D space.

To use it, install the [ArduinoLSM9DS1 library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLSM9DS1) and check the examples.

The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a built-in microphone, the ...

### Measuring air quality with the Sensirion ESS-C3 shield
The [Sensirion ESS-C3 shield](https://developer.sensirion.com/platforms/environmental-sensor-shield/) contains environmental sensors to measure temperature, humidity, TVOC and CO2.

To use it, install the [Sensirion ESS library](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-ess) and check the examples.

To connect the Sensirion shield to the Arduino Nano you need an adapter, e.g. the [NanUno v2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4171213).
