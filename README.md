## Arduino Nano BLE Sense
The [Arduino Nano BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) is a microcontroller, a small computer that runs a single program.

The Nano uses *3.3V* logic. Here is the pinout, a map of all general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins:

### Getting started with the Nano
See https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense

### Measuring humidity and temperature with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a humidity and temperature sensor, the ...

### Measuring barometric pressure with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a barometric pressure sensor, the [LPS22HB](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lps22hb.pdf).

To use it, install the [ArduinoLPS22HB library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLPS22HB) and check the examples.

### Measuring orientation in space of the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a 9-axis inertial measuring unit (IMU) built-in.

The [LSM9DS1](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm9ds1.pdf) includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer.

To use it, install the [ArduinoLSM9DS1 library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLSM9DS1) and check the examples.

### Measuring noise and recording audio with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a built-in microphone, the [MP34DT05](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/mp34dt05-a.pdf) which outputs [PDM signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation).

To use it, install the [PDM library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PDM) and the [ArduinoSound library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound) and check the examples.

### Measuring gestures, color or proximity with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a light intensity sensor, the [APDS9960](https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/AV02-4191EN).

The multifunctional sensor can detect gestures, light color and proximity.

To use it, install the [ArduinoAPDS9960 library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoAPDS9960) and check the examples.

### Measuring air quality with the Sensirion ESS-C3 shield
The [Sensirion ESS-C3 shield](https://developer.sensirion.com/platforms/environmental-sensor-shield/) has environmental sensors to measure temperature, humidity, TVOC and CO2.

To connect the Sensirion shield to the Nano you need a hardware adapter, e.g. the [NanUno v2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4171213).

To use the sensors, install the [Sensirion ESS library](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-ess) and check the examples.
