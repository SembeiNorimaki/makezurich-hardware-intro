## Arduino Nano BLE Sense
The [Arduino Nano BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) is a microcontroller, a small computer that runs a single program.

The Nano uses *3.3V* logic. Here is the pinout, a map of all general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins:

### Installing the Arduino IDE
[Download the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), we recommend the desktop version, which shows up as *Arduino* once installed.

The IDE (integrated development environment) is a simple tool to write, build and deploy programs.

### Getting started with the Nano
Follow this guide to [get started with the Arduino Nano BLE Sense](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense#toc2).

Or just open *Tools > Board > Board Manager...* and add the *Arduino nRF528x Boards* package.

Then select *Tools > Board > Arduino NANO 33 BLE*, plug in the Nano via USB and select it in the *Tools > Port* menu.

Finally, open *File > Examples > Basics > Blink* and click the ⮕ *Upload* button. (Driver issues? Check the guide above.)

### Learning the Arduino language
The [Arduino language](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) is very similar to C, libraries are written in C++.

This is *Blink*, the *Hello, World!* of embedded programming:
```
int ledPin = 13;

void setup() { // runs once
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() { // runs forever
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turn the LED pin on
  delay(1000);                // wait for 1000ms = 1s
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // turn the LED pin off
  delay(1000);                // wait again
}
```

### Installing a library for the Nano
Follow these steps to [install an Arduino library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

Or just open *Sketch > Include library > Manage libraries...* and type the library name.

Then check the *File > Examples > LIBRARY_NAME* menu in the Arduino IDE.

### Measuring humidity and temperature with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a humidity and temperature sensor, the [HTS221](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/HTS221.pdf).

To use it, install the [ArduinoHTS221 library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoHTS221) and check the examples.

### Measuring barometric pressure with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a barometric pressure sensor, the [LPS22HB](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lps22hb.pdf).

To use it, install the [ArduinoLPS22HB library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLPS22HB) and check the examples.

### Measuring orientation in space of the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a 9-axis inertial measuring unit (IMU) built-in.

The [LSM9DS1](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm9ds1.pdf) includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer.

To use it, install the [ArduinoLSM9DS1 library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLSM9DS1) and check the examples.

### Measuring noise and recording audio with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a built-in microphone, the [MP34DT05](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/mp34dt05-a.pdf) which outputs [PDM signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation).

To use it, install the [PDM library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PDM) and the [ArduinoSound library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound) and check the examples.

### Measuring gestures, color or proximity with the Nano
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has a light intensity sensor, the [APDS9960](https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/AV02-4191EN).

The multifunctional sensor can detect gestures, light color and proximity.

To use it, install the [ArduinoAPDS9960 library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoAPDS9960) and check the examples.

### Measuring air quality with the Sensirion ESS-C3 shield
The [Sensirion ESS-C3 shield](https://developer.sensirion.com/platforms/environmental-sensor-shield/) has environmental sensors to measure temperature, humidity, TVOC and CO2.

To connect the Sensirion shield to the Nano you can use the [TODO]() or a [NanUno v2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4171213) hardware adapter.

To use the sensors, install the [Sensirion ESS library](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-ess) and check the examples.

### Sending data to TheThingsNetwork with the Murata LoRaWAN board
The [Murata B-L072Z-LRWAN1 board](https://www.st.com/resource/en/data_brief/b-l072z-lrwan1.pdf) can be used as a modem to send data to [TheThingsNetwork](http://thethingsnetwork.org/) (TTN).

To connect the Murata board to the Nano you can use the [TODO]() hardware adapter.

### Sending data from the Nano with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
The Arduino Nano BLE Sense has built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity.

This allows you to connect to the Nano from a phone, laptop or another BLE device.

To use it, follow [this tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoBLE) or install the [ArduinoBLE library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE) and check the examples.

## Arduino Uno
The [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) is a microcontroller.

The Uno uses *5V* logic, the pinout is printed right on the board:
