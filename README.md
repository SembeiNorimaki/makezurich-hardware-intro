# #MakeZurich hardware intro
Hello, this is some of the hardware available at [MakeZurich.ch](http://makezurich.ch/).

Found a bug or have a question? [Create an issue](../../issues).

## Arduino Nano BLE Sense
The [Arduino Nano BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) is a microcontroller.

It uses 3.3V logic, here is the pinout:

### Getting started with Arduino Nano BLE

### Using the onboard accelerometer and other sensors

### Sending data to TheThingsNetwork backend with LoRaWAN using the Murata shield

### Measuring temperature, humidity, TVOC and CO2 with the Sensirion ESS-C3 SGPC3 shield

Install the Sensirion library, as described in https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-ess and check the examples.

### Reading data on the Arduino Nano BLE Sense from a phone or laptop with Bluetooth Low Energy

## Arduino Uno
The [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) is a microcontroller.

It uses 5V logic, the pinout is printed right on the board:
