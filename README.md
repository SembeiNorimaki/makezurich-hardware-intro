# #MakeZurich hardware intro
Hello, this is some of the hardware available at [MakeZurich.ch](http://makezurich.ch/).

Found a bug or have a question? [Create an issue](../../issues).

## Arduino Nano BLE Sense
The [Arduino Nano BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) is a microcontroller.

It uses 3.3V logic, here is the pinout:

### Getting started

See https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense

### Using onboard sensors

> The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense [...] comes with a series of embedded sensors:
>
> * 9 axis inertial sensor
> * humidity, and temperature sensor
> * barometric sensor
> * microphone
> * gesture, proximity, light color and light intensity sensor

### Measuring TVOC & CO2 with ESS-C3

### Sending data to TheThingsNetwork with LoRaWAN

Install the Sensirion library, as described in https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-ess and check the examples.

### Sending data from the Nano with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

## Arduino Uno
The [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) is a microcontroller.

It uses 5V logic, the pinout is printed right on the board:
