Hello, this is some of the hardware available at the [MakeZurich.ch](http://makezurich.ch/) hackdays. Found a bug? [Create an issue](issues).

## Arduino Nano BLE Sense

### Getting started with Arduino Nano BLE

### Using the onboard accelerometer and other sensors

### Sending data to TheThingsNetwork backend with LoRaWAN using the Murata shield

### Measuring temperature, humidity, TVOC and CO2 with the Sensirion ESS-C3 SGPC3 shield

Install the Sensirion library, as described in https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-ess and check the examples.

### Reading data on the Arduino Nano BLE Sense from a phone or laptop with Bluetooth Low Energy
